Installation
============

DayZ Dev Tools is listed on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/dayz-dev-tools/>`_.
I highly recommend installing it using `pipx <https://pypa.github.io/pipx/>`_
for command line use:

.. code:: bash

   pipx install dayz-dev-tools

It can also be installed with ``pip`` or using your preferred Python package
manager.

.. code:: bash

   pip install dayz-dev-tools

DayZ Dev Tools can be run on Windows or Linux but Python 3.8 or higher is
required.
